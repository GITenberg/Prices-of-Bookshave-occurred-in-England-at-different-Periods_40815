description: By 1898, books had become more affordable than they had been in the past,
  leading to greater literacy and a barometer of society's cultural and intellectual
  status. Using price points to trace the history of publishing and reading, the author
  considers manuscript prices, booksellers, auctions throughout the centuries, and
  prices of the earliest printed books.
